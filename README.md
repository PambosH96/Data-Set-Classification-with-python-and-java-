# Data-Set-Classification-with-python-and-java-

In this task you are asked to put into practice one or more algorithms  classification algorithms on a given data set and to  prepare a technical report, according to the specifications given below. 

The classification of the dataset will be based on:  
* the classification methods taught in the course 
* a library of categorization algorithms (e.g., in Python with Scikit-Learn,  in Java with the WEKA API) that has implemented categorization algorithms 
* other techniques/algorithms that can be found in external sources, such as books,  articles, etc. (all external sources used should be mentioned  in terms of methods and/or code).
